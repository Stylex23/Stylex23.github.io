  <h2>Contact Service Narrative</h2>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The artifact I selected for my ePortfolio is a Contact Management System originally developed in Java for a previous course. This system consists of two core classes, Contact and ContactService, as well as corresponding JUnit test files. It supports essential functions such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving contact information, while enforcing data validation and encapsulation. I chose this artifact because it highlights my skills in writing clean, modular code, applying object-oriented principles, and performing automated unit testing.

Throughout the enhancement process, I made several improvements to the codebase. These included improved phone number validation, clearer error messaging when updates fail, and the integration of Log4j for robust logging. I also incorporated inline comments and Javadoc to enhance documentation and code readability. In addition to these quality-of-life changes, I extended the backend logic by replacing the ArrayList with a HashMap for faster lookups and introduced a PriorityQueue to manage urgent contacts by priority. A merge sort was implemented to improve the alphabetical sorting of contact records.

The enhancements went further to simulate database behaviors by introducing a data snapshot feature to represent backups and indexing-inspired contact management through structured data access. This approach not only preserved the existing systemâ€™s functionality but also made it more scalable and performance-optimized. These additions helped me meet learning outcomes related to the use of data structures, algorithms, and backend design principles.

During the enhancement phase, I encountered challenges such as handling multiple error scenarios in the update method, which I addressed with detailed try-catch logic and informative user feedback. Another complex task was integrating sorting logic in a way that preserved object-oriented integrity while improving maintainability. Enhancing the artifact required careful refactoring to avoid side effects and data corruption while adding more robust features. This work has deepened my understanding of balancing software design with user and system requirements.

Overall, this artifact showcases my growth as a developer and my readiness for more advanced roles in software engineering. It reflects my ability to transform a functional application into a more maintainable, optimized, and production-ready system, while adhering to real-world coding and design standards.</pre>
