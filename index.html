    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      I am a dedicated and detail-oriented computer science student with a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and database systems. This ePortfolio showcases artifacts that reflect my progression and mastery of industry-relevant skills such as unit testing, data handling with MongoDB, and real-time application logic. Through rigorous enhancements, I’ve applied course outcomes to real-world simulations, demonstrating readiness for a software engineering career.
