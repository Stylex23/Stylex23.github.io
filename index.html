    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, I have grown both technically and professionally. Developing this ePortfolio allowed me to reflect on the skills I’ve gained and how I’ve applied them in realistic projects. Each course offered an opportunity to explore different aspects of software development, from core programming and data structures to advanced topics like testing, databases, and security. Creating this portfolio has been an eye-opening experience that reaffirmed my profe...

      One of the most transformative experiences came from learning to collaborate effectively in team environments, particularly in group assignments and code reviews where collective input led to stronger implementations. Additionally, communicating technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders improved during my work in capstone planning, presentations, and code documentation. I learned how to balance technical clarity with accessible language—a skill essential to working in inter...

      My strengths in data structures and algorithms were sharpened through multiple coding projects where performance mattered. I became proficient in selecting appropriate structures like HashMaps, PriorityQueues, and trees for efficient data access and manipulation. Likewise, my coursework in software engineering emphasized clean architecture, modular design, and maintainability. I also gained hands-on experience with relational and non-relational databases, applying query optimization and schema design...

      Security was integrated across many courses and was particularly impactful in projects that simulated real-world vulnerabilities. From input validation to understanding authentication workflows, I’ve adopted a mindset of building secure and user-friendly software from the ground up. These experiences make me confident in designing systems that are not only functional but resilient and ethical.

      This ePortfolio brings together a range of artifacts that demonstrate the breadth and depth of my capabilities. The Contact Management System, in particular, highlights my grasp of object-oriented principles, software testing, and data handling. The enhancements I made to this artifact reflect my growth in writing scalable and maintainable code while also applying concepts like logging and error management. As a whole, the portfolio showcases my readiness to take on complex development roles with ...
